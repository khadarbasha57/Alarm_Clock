# Alarm_Clock

A Python-based GUI application to set alarms using a 24-hour format. When the set time is reached, a custom sound (sound.wav) is played. Built with tkinter for the interface and pygame for sound playback. Run alarm.py to use; ensure dependencies are installed and the sound file is in the same directory.
